    <h1>Hello, I’m Parth Patel</h1>
    <p>Short bio: I’m a student at Old Dominion University pursuing my Masters in Computer Science. I will be interning for AT&T over the summer in hopes for a full time position.
    In my free time I enjoy playing video games such as call of duty, crypto trading, and watching and playing sports mostly basketball and football.</p>
